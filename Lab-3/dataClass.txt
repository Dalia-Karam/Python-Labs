dataclass: it is a decorator that simplifies the creation of classes by automatically generating special methods.
without using dataclasses we will need to define the methods manually making the code more repetitive

example:

from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class Person:
    name: str
    age: int
    city: str

#create an instance
p1 = Person("Dalia", 24, "Cairo")

#accessing attributes and printing them
print(p1.name)  
print(p1.age)   
print(p1.city)  

#string representation (auto-generated __repr__ method)
print(p1)  #output should be: Person(name='Dalia', age=24, city='Cairo')
